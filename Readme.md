Download and read data from the Electic Power Consumption dataset from the UC Irvine 
Machine Learning Repository.  Generate 4 plots:

1. Generate a histogram of global active power for the two-day period 2/1/2007 to 
    2/2/2007.  Output file: plot1.png.

2. Generate a line graph showing the time series of global active power for the two-day
    period 2/1/2007 to 2/2/2007.  Output file: plot2.png.

3. Generate a line graph showing the time series of submeter active power for the two-day
    period 2/1/2007 to 2/2/2007.  Output file: plot3.png.

4. Generate a 4x4 array of line graphs showing the time series of global active power,
    voltage, submeter power, and global reactive power for the two-day period 2/1/2007 to
    2/2/2007.  Output file: plot4.png.
